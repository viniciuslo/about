# Hello, everyone 👋
I'm Vinicius, a Data Engineering Specialist passionate about turning data into valuable insights and strategic decisions.

🔭 Currently, I work in Business Intelligence at a fashion e-commerce company, where I help optimize processes and create data-driven strategies.

🌱 I am continuously improving my skills, studying data science applied to engineering to simplify the presentation of complex information and facilitate decision-making, increasing engagement in business analysis.

💻 In addition to my expertise in data engineering, I have a strong background in system development, which allows me to understand and bridge the gap between data and technology.
